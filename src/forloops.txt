    Loops are designed to repeat code over a certain number of times to accomplish a given purpose.
    three kinds of common loops are "for" loops, "while" loops, and "do while" loops. Think 9 steps generally for a file
    with a loop.
    1.remember to include your stdio library. DO YOU REMEMBER HOW?
            ANSWER #include <stdio>
    2.remember every file needs a main file; do you remember the syntax for main?
            ANSWER int main(){}
    3.remember the next step: We need to declare any variables we're going to use so our system recognizes them.
            ANSWER declare variables
            In this case we're going to declare the variales nm sum, count as follows: int n, count, sum=0. We only need to
            use int once, and sometimes you need to set the initial value of a variable; in this case we have set the initial
            value = to 0.
    int n, count, sum=0;
    4.printf
    printf("Enter the value of n.\n");
    5.scanf
    scanf("%d",&n);

    6.then for loop(){}
    //(initialization statement; test expression; update statement)
    for(count=1;count<=n;++count)  //for loop terminates if count>n
        {
    7.[do something] printf
    printf("Sum=%d",sum);
    8. return 0;
